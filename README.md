Customer obsessed Product Science Explorer, biased towards experimentation and rapid iterations to uncover and solve customer problems. Focused on blending customer needs with viable options to deliver multiple prototypes for quick product growth. Transitioned from Data/Product Analyst role and currently working as a 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 at 𝐅𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐲𝐟

When not thinking about customer problems and business goals, I like to update and upgrade myself with new technologies and skill-sets relevant to my field. I'm passionate about analytical philosophy and aspiring to build better data-driven applications. In my spare time, I watch soccer and listen to podcasts.

This github profiles is for my personal projects & professional assignments, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
